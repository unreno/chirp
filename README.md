### Preparations and TSQL Code for creating the data warehouse

The [Children's Health Information and Registry Program, or CHIRP](http://chirp.unr.edu), is a collaboration between northern Nevada's Child Health Institute (CHI) and the University of Nevada, Reno to improve the health of children born in Washoe County. CHIRP is developing a patient registry-based health intelligence platform that receives, stores and organizes the health information of Washoe County children. The platform will serve CHI and the pediatric community by providing comprehensive, longitudinal data for tailored patient care and research.

This health intelligence platform will store all of its data securely at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno campus. The platform is comprised of three components:

1. An observational registry that collects medical and public health data from providers and the State of Nevada, such as birth and immunization records, newborn screenings and hospital discharge records on children born in Washoe County until their 18th birthday.
2. A data warehouse that compiles and organizes aggregated, de-identified health data to inform public health reporting, research and interventions in Washoe County.
3. A digital product that sends secure, encrypted alerts to a child's healthcare provider, updating them on their patient's health progress.
