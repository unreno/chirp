-- I had previously understood that BULK INSERT will not respect quoted 
-- field delimiters, even if in a properly quoted csv file.
-- This isn't entirely true. 
-- Somehow, if the last column is text, it won't try to split it.
-- For example, 2 column table integer id and text value
-- csv file contains  1,2,3,4
-- BULK INSERT will assign 1 to id and 2,3,4 to text.
-- This seems to be a very special case, so don't count on it.


-- Also, BULK INSERT is all or nothing.
-- Using something like ERRORFILE to catch failed records is good.
-- ERRORFILE =''C:\Users\gwendt\Desktop\testerrors.csv'',

-- This file MUST NOT EXIST.
-- Also this file + ".Error.Txt" MUST NOT EXIST


-- Also, MAXERRORS = 1 does not seem to actually work as expected.

-- Quite frankly the default of 10, if it works, is a bad idea. 
-- It should be all or nothing.
