Of course, Microsoft STILL puts its Control-M's at the end of a line in a tsv. This is attached to the last column so need to remove it if going to print it.

It seems that this data set includes all who've died in Nevada in the time frame
regardless or birth date or birth place.
Out of the ~160k death records, only ~1500 were born in Nevada after 2009.
It does not include the birth county, so it is difficult to determine if should find a match.
Only about 200-300 death records match a birth record state file number.
